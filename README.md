1- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Gaming Room was a smartphone game developer that had popularity with an Android puzzle contest application. The customer desired to create a web-based version of its existing Android app in order to have it available on many different platforms and devices.

2- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- I produced a detailed suggestion section covering critical areas for the customer to think about, such as the host operating system, memory and storage management solutions on host servers, the API framework, security, and the benefits of launching the product using a serverless architecture. I created a compelling argument for why a platform in the cloud was the ideal option for the customer and the goals they had.

3- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
-Studying the subject matter model as a UML class diagram aided to comprehend the framework and relationships of objects representing app elements. This aided in the development of compact classes with basic methods that directly utilized other things to construct a clean prototype.

4- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- A closer dig into the intricacies between the operating systems on the client side might improve the assessment part by comparing and contrasting common OSs and mobile platforms. The web browser is the primary client-side issue since it is the engine that runs the program for the client. Research examining the differences between operating systems for web-based applications yielded limited results. OS preference for specific browsers should be investigated further to see whether non-favored browsers impose technical or performance limits.

5- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- When designing web-based apps, the user's primary demands are efficiency and intuitiveness. Quality aspects are also significant, but not as much as speed and usefulness. If a user does not like the design of the program, they may continue to use it, but they will quit if its operation is confusing or sluggish. User demands are of fundamental importance since, as the product's user, they are the client's primary source of money.

6-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

-To develop software, start vague and work your way up to precision. Establish high-level goals and develop them via several iterations to arrive at the ultimate answer. A client's business objectives, for example, might be broken down into functional requirements that outline the major components of functionality required to satisfy those goals. technological requirements that explain the technological approach to functional fulfillment might be subdivided from practical demands. Technical requirements may then be converted into design papers, architecture, and code that meet those criteria and produce the final product.
